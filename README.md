# Coding behind the scenes

This repository contains all the projects I've developed in [my Twitch show](https://twitch.tv/voscarmv). Watch [the intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNrfZAZCe6I) for an explenation about the inspiration and motivation behind the show (please disregard the robot voice ðŸ¤–).

## Episode 1: Drawing a line

In this episode I explored a way to draw a line on an HTML5 canvas using the mouse position. Watch the video [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/593304668). Check out the source code [here](/connected_lines)
